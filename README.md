# Personal doctor fitness bracelet


This is my first serious-ish project! I developed a system for remote monitoring of human health that can monitor a number of parameters, including patient's body temperature, heart rate, blood pressure, humidity, and ambient temperature. The system can display key parameters on the screen, analyze them, and transmit the necessary information to the attending physician via the Internet.

You can look into the [pdf file](https://github.com/sathworld/personal-doctor-fitness-bracelet/blob/main/Personal%20doctor%20fitness%20bracelet.pdf) that goes in-depth on the methods I used when creating it. 
__Disclaimer: I used machine translation and then did a couple of proof-reads; nevertheless, there could be grammar constructs that are incorrect.__
